  <h1>Python in Ethereum: Background and Context</h1>
  
  <!-- Content here: -->

    <p>After going through all this Solidity content, (which <i>looks</i> like Javascript but as you now know is very different from Javascript) we may have some Python developers saying, "What about us?"</p>

    <p>Python is, after all, one of the most popular and accessible programming languages. When people want to start programming, they typically feel they have to decide between Javascript or Python. So, what gives? Where's the Python in Ethereum?</p>

    <p>While it's not as popular as Solidity and Javascript, there are some exciting ways to build on Ethereum on Python. In this section, we're going to go over a few of those projects. In the following section, we'll go over <a href="https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vyper,</a> the programming language whose syntax is a subset of Python's.</p>

    <h2>Vyper</h2>
      <p>Vyper is an experimental, contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Please note: <a href="https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/10/vyper-preliminary-security-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there have been some issues with the Vyper compiler.</a> Like Python, writing clear, understandable code is of primary importance in Vyper.</p>

      <p>Vyper is not trying to be a replacement for Solidity. It is meant to be a more security focused smart contract programming language and will likely not be able to do everything that Solidity can. It's development is uncertain and not nearly as strong as Solidity. You can read more about Vyper in this section <a href="https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

      <p>Note that you can use Vyper with a number of development frameworks, including <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration#vyper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truffle</a> and Brownie.</p>

    <h2>Brownie and Web3.py</h2>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brownie</a> is a Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts running on the EVM. It uses <a href="https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web3.py</a> as well as Solidity. It is most well-known for being the development framework the <a href="https://yearn.finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yearn.Finance</a> team uses to build their powerful DeFi platform and <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/curve-dao-token--crv-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRV.</a></p>  

      <p>Brownie definitely takes some notes from Truffle (they are both "sweet"), including having a <code>brownie init</code> command and their equivalent of Truffle boxes, <a href="https://github.com/brownie-mix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Brownie Mixes."</a> This makes it an easy tool for a lot of Truffle developers familiar with Truffle.</p>

      <p>Here are some tutorials to introduce you to Brownie:
        <ul>

        </ul>

    <h2>Yellow Paper rewrite</h2>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/pipermerriam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piper Merriam</a> is a Python-based Ethereum developer who works for the Ethereum Foundation. They have proposed an <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/replace-the-yellow-paper-with-executable-markdown-specification/6430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interesting project</a>: Replacing <a href="https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum's yellow paper</a> (which we studied earlier) with executable markdown. This was inspired by Ethereum 2.0's <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon chain specifications.</a> Rather than writing a document of specifications, the Ethereum 2.0 developer teams built a series of tests based on the spec conditions of a theoretical Beacon chain. Then, Ethereum 2.0 software clients only had to make sure they passed those tests.</p>

      <p>Merriam is proposing a similar exercise, but for Ethereum Mainnet (the PoW chain), based in Python adn to replace the yellow paper (which can be very challenging to read). It would rely heavily on <a href="https://py-evm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">py-EVM</a> (a Python implementation of the EVM). The whole project is very new and you can check <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it's Github repository</a> for updates. Maybe you even get involved!</p>

    <h2>Fe</h2>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/fe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fe</a> is "an emerging smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain." It's influenced both by Python <i>and</i> Rust and was released in January 2021. You can read more about it <a href="https://snakecharmers.ethereum.org/fe-a-new-language-for-the-ethereum-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
    
      <p>While more niche, it's possible to be a Python developer and contribute to the Ethereum (and wider blockchain) ecosystem! Solidity is still important to know, but we hope this gets you started finding more Python opportunities.</p>
